<h1>Blackjack Game</h1>
This was the first non-trivial application I made for the Tealeaf Academy ruby course. Recently, the game was re-factored from a procedural to an OOP style setup.

<h3>Summary of the game:</h3>
The object of the game is to get up to, but not over, 21 points in order to beat the dealer's hand. Each player is dealt 2 cards at the start of a round. On their turn, a player may draw one card ("hit") or decided to stop ("stand") and take their current score for that hand. This may be repeated as long as they are at or below 21 (ie. not "busted").

<h3>Card Point Values:</h3>
Aces are worth either 1 or 11 points, all face cards are worth 10 points, and all other cards are worth face value.

<h3>Getting 'Blackjack':</h3>
If a player gets a 10 or a face card along with an Ace as their starting hand this is known as a blackjack (21 points) and results in a larger payout, provided that the dealer does not have one as well.
