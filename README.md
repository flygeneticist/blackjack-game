<h1>Blackjack Game</h1>
==============

This was the first non-trivial app I made for Tealeaf Academy ruby course. Recently, re-factored from procedural to OOP style.

<h2>Summary of the game:</h2>
The object of the game is to get up to, but not over, 21 points in order to beat the dealer's hand. Each player is dealt 2 cards at the start of a round. On their turn, a player may draw one card ("Hit") or decided to stop ("Stand") with their current score. This may be repeated as long as they are at or below 21 ("Busted").

<h2>Card Point Values:</h2>
Aces are worth either 1 or 11 points, all face cards are worth 10 points, and all other cards are worth face value.

<h2>Getting 'Blackjack':</h2>
If a player gets a 10 or a face card along with an Ace as their starting hand this is known as a blackjack (21 points) and results in a larger payout, provided that the dealer does not have one as well.
